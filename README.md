# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

Analysis of Employee Database with SQL 

## Overview of Project 

Using Postgres and Entity Relationship Diagram, a relation database was created Pewlett Hackard. The database consisted of tables containing employee information, salaries, departments, department managers, job titles and departments that employees belong to. The data was imported into tables using Postgres and PgAdmin and the tables were joined by primary keys to perform queries. 

### Results 
1.	The Entity Relationship Diagram or ERD was created to visualize the relationship between each table and served as a blue print in constructing the database thereby allowing the user to make queries and pull data from multiple tables.
